To Run you will need to download the other file which is a csv with all the data. 

You will then click on the Datamining_Project that is part of the google colab.
You will want to click the open in colab. (Sorry for the white light)
You will want to run the block of codes from top to bottom. 

At the uploaded section you want to find the csv you already downloaded. 
Then just run the rest and have a great time :D.
